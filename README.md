# Configuration

To start the Spring Boot server, first install Maven (install JDK 8 instead of JDK 10):

With maven now added to the system PATH, you can open a terminal and navigate to the project root and run:

`mvn spring-boot:run`

The server will now be running on port 8080.


You can use the React client to interact with the server. To start it, first install Node:

Open a terminal and navigate to the `client` directory in the project folder. Run:

`npm install`

And then to start the server, run:

`npm run start`

This will open a browser window with the Servo home page.
